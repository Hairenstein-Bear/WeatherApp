# WeatherApp
Simple Weather App calling a REST API from openweathermap.org
I created this app to show my knowledge of REST API architecture and how to access properties of an API.  It was coded in VScode and made using HTML and JavaScript.

My plan is to eventually incorporate dynamic backgrounds that change based on local weather such as clouds slowly drifting past on a partly cloudy day or rain
falling in the background on a rainy day.
